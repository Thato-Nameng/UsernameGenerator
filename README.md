# UsernameGenerator
### Overview
I have developed a user-centric Python program that dynamically generates unique names. This program that uses 
a command-line interface and efficiently stores the data in a text file.

#### Key Features
- Generates a unique bootcamp username based on personal information provided by the user.
- Prompts the user to input their First Name, Last Name, Province, and Study Year.
- Validates user input to ensure First Name and Last Name do not contain digits, and Study Year is not a digit.
- Prevents saving duplicated data in the text file.
